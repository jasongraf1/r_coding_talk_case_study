# Using R for linguistic research: Case study 

This is a small repo for illustrating how I use R for corpus linguistic research. The case study illustrates:

- Data collection from Twitter
- Data cleaning and annotation with tidy tools
- Data visualization and analysis
- Writing reports with `{knitr}` and r markdown
- Reproducible worflows and project management with `{targets}` package: [https://books.ropensci.org/targets/](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/). 

The complete analysis can be replicated by downloading data and scripts, installing necessary packages, and then running `tar_make()`.
