In this study we examine a well-known yet little understood dialect feature of English, namely the past participle forms *sat* and *stood* with progressive meaning, as illustrated in (1) and (2).

(@) My work colleague ***is sat*** eating honey out of a jar with a spoon. <Twitter>
(@) I ***was stood*** chatting with a friend in the street in Darlington when we saw it. <GloWbE-GB>

Though frequently mentioned in dialect surveys [e.g. @cheshire_urban_1989; @kortmann_electronic_2014], relatively little is known about this feature's precise geographical distribution or historical origins. Prior studies have relied on relatively small datasets [e.g. @klemola_still_1999; @stange_was_2016], which limit our ability to discern reliable synchronic or diachronic patterns. For this study we collected over 100k tokens from large-scale corpora, both contemporary (Table \@ref(tab:corpus-tab)) and historical (Table \@ref(tab:hist-tab)), to explore the current geographical distribution of *BE sat/stood* and reconsider some competing claims about its origins. Drawing upon this evidence, we argue that *BE sat/stood* is most likely a recent innovation, rather than a remnant of an older Germanic *BE* perfect system, e.g. *I'm not seen it* [cf. @buchstaller_morphosyntactic_2015].

On Twitter, *BE sat/stood* is widespread throughout most of England and Wales, and is particularly prominent in the North and Southwest of England (Figure \@ref(fig:twit1)). Data from the corpus of Global Web-based English (GloWbE) confirms that *BE sat/stood* is quite rare outside the UK (Figure \@ref(fig:glowbe-plots); see also @kortmann_electronic_2014), and we find no mention of it in the literature of other English varieties, including regions that retain a more productive *BE* perfect system [@filppula_irish_2004, 75; @melchers_english_2004, 39-40; @werner_rise_2016]. This is all the more striking in light of well documented founder effects in North America for other (older) morphosyntactic features [e.g. @montgomery_historical_2009; @strelluf_needs_2020; @yerastov_reflexes_2016]. Further, we find only scant traces of *BE sat/stood* in historical corpora prior to the 1700s [cf. @kyto_be_1997], and no mention of it in pre-20th century dialect surveys or commentaries. Our findings therefore suggest that *BE sat/stood* is not likely an echo of the *BE* perfect, despite their superficial similarities.

Following @klemola_still_1999, we propose that *BE sat/stood* is more likely an 18th century innovation, and represents a curious case of a change from above resulting in a change from below. It is likely that progressive *BE sat* is a result of a hypercorrection of the older past participle form *sitten* as it was increasingly replaced by the standard form *sat* in the 17th and 18th centuries. This older variant persisted in the North of England into the 1800s [@klemola_still_1999], where northern speakers over-extended *sat* to progressive contexts in which *sitten* was largely homophonous with the progressive participle variant *sittin'* ([sɪtɪn]). 

We conclude with a brief look at the linguistic and external factors conditioning variation between *sat* and *sitting*, and discuss directions for future research.
